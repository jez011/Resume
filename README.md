Hello! I am Jordon, and this GitHub will be used as a testing ground for some basic code to show potential employers what I can do. I have a Bachelor's in Cybersecurity however also have much experience with programming and software UIs pertaining to it, such as visual studio, codeblocks, terminal/cmd, and so on. I also have many tools and am still actively learning in the cybersecurity space, such as Wireshark, nmap, Kali services in general, SIEM, Firewall management, and security management a seperate server. 
Although I am knew to GitHub, I look forward to utilizing the service more often and hopefully learn more C++ in the mean time.
